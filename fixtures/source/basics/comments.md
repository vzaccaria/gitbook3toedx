Comments

Commenti!!

In Javascript, comments can be written in 2 different ways:

-   Line starting with `//`:

<!-- -->

``` javascript
// This is a comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter
var a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```

-   Section of code starting with `/*`and ending with `*/`, this method
    is used for multi-line comments:

<!-- -->

``` javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment,
it will be ignored by the interpreter
*/
var a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```
